        <p>
          I was initially hired to redesign the (at the time) outdated user interface without major UX interventions.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the
          decision about new visual elements was made, I helped the front-end developer to implement the design on 100+
          pages
          through the application, mostly by overriding the existing CSS styles and in some cases, re-structuring the
          HTML to
          support the new design.
        </p>
        <p>
          The collaboration was very successful, so I was happy to continue working on new features and improving the
          existing
          ones as a UX/UI designer and HTML/CSS developer.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some of the functionality I was working on: Project Boards, Project Task List, Gantt Chart, My Checklist,
          Reports,
          custom theming, advanced filters, document upload flow, comments and conversations, time tracking etc.
        </p>

        <h5>Design and Implementation Process:</h5>
        <p>

          I would first discuss the requirements with the Project Owner, create a few low-fidelity versions of the
          layout and
          flow.</p>
        <p>After a thorough analysis and feedback from the team I would apply changes we agreed on and create
          high-fidelity
          mockups (with the design applied) for final approval of the UI.</p>
        <p>Then I would code HTML/CSS templates and send them over to the front-end developer, along with detailed
          implementation
          instructions.</p>
        <p>I would be available for any questions or fixes during the development phase, and finally,
          participate in
          testing of the new feature.

        <p><strong>Project Management - Table View</strong><br />
          This screen is a starting point for admin users that shows overview of current state of the projects and
          tasks.
          It was
          important to show visual hierarchy between workspaces, projects and tasks and highlight any possible blockers.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p><strong>Project Management - Gantt Chart</strong><br />
          A visual overview of the tasks in the form of a timeline - this is probably the most complex template in the
          app, that allows for both horizontal and verical scrolling, collapsing left (table) part of the chart,
          expanding/collapsing workspaces, projects and tasks.</p>
      </div>

        <p><strong>Example of a low-fidelity mockup / wireframe
          </strong><br />
          As a starting point of designing a new feature,
          I would first discuss the requirements with the Project Owner and create a few low-fidelity versions of the
          layout and
          flow. The goal was to put visual design aside and focus on functionality and flow.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <div class="img-container">
          <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/projects/{{ page.slug }}/{{ page.slug }}-06.{{ page.img-type }}"
            alt="{{ page.title }}" />

        <p><strong>Example of a high-fidelity mockup
          </strong><br />
          After a thorough analysis of low-fidelity mockups and feedback from the team I would apply changes we agreed
          on
          and
          create high-fidelity mockups (with the design applied) for final approval of the UI</p>

            alt="{{ page.title }}" />
        </div>
        <p><strong>Example of several high-fidelity design variants
          </strong><br />
          Some Ui elements that were used more frequently required some more design variants to choose from, so we are
          sure the
          final version looks and feels right. From these variants, the first one was selected, as the lightest and
          cleanest.</p>

        <div class="img-container">

            alt="{{ page.title }}" />
        </div>
        <p><strong>Example of a HTML/CSS template
          </strong><br />
          After final approval of UI design, I would code HTML/CSS templates and send them over to the front-end
          developer, along
          with detailed implementation instructions. I would be available for any questions or fixes during the
          development phase,
          and finally, participate in testing of the new feature.</p>

            alt="{{ page.title }}" />
        </div>
        <p><strong>Example of theaming
          </strong><br />
          Users had an option to adjust visual appearance of the app (navigation bar, colors) or parts of the app - in
          this case users could choose one of the 7 board colors, so they can easily distinguish one board from the
          other.
          The goal was to apply different themes with as few interventions in the DOM as possible, so it's easier for
          front-ennd developers to maintain the code.
