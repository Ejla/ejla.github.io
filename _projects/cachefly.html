    <div class=" row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          My role as a UX/UI designer was to structure and design the portal so it can accommodate the needs of both
          small clients
          with just several services, and large clients with 100+ services, multiple users and various levels of
          user
          permissions.
          The portal needed to support a simple setup flow for basic services, and more advanced configuration
          tools,
          along with
          2FA and biometric authentication for additional security.
        </p>
        <p>
          Much effort was put into selecting and designing relevant Reports and Data Visualisations to show various
          related
          metrics and their geographic distribution through different timespans.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          The portal needed to be functional both on large desktop screens and smartphones which was super
          challenging due to the complexity of some of the screens.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was also in charge of front-end coding (HTML, CSS/SCSS) so I was able to immediately test some of the
          responsive
          concepts and layouts, and hand over well-tested, bullet-proof html/css templates to the React developer.

      <p><strong>Responsive design</strong><br />
        The portal needed to be functional both on large desktop screens and smartphones which was super challenging due

      <p><strong>Configuration Wizard</strong><br />
        Configuring a CDN service requires multiple actions, so we designed a wizard that takes care of the basic setup
