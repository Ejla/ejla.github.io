<p>What is UX design exactly and what is actual expertise of a UX designer? When we come to think about it, it's kind of fuzzy, isn't it?</p>

<p>But what we do know, or better said - feel - is the difference between good UX and bad UX, don't we? We feel angry when the product is not working as we expected, confused when we don't know what to do next, irritated when we have to fill out some enormous form with information that simply can't be relevant...<br/> 
On the other hand we feel satisfied, smart, sometimes even amazed, when we get through some complicated process without friction and question marks above our heads - somebody there really thought about how we will feel. Somebody that cares.</p>

<p>So there it is, that is the first and most important characteristic of a good UX designer - they CARE about how you will feel while using the product. And from that caring all the good things follow.</p>
<p>The mission of UX designers is to empathize with you as a user, try to predict the context in which you will be using the product, how you will be thinking and feeling, in other words, try to experience it from your point of view. That way they can remove the obstacles in your way, answer questions you might have, put visual clues for you to easily find your way, organize and classify things to lower your cognitive load...</p>

<h5>Research</h5>
<p>So how do UX designers do that, how can they know so much about us?</p> 
<p>Well, by using all means available ;)<br/>
Research is a good start - about subject matter, about similar products, about users - what motivates them, what are their habits...</p>
<p>Research can be done in different ways - one of the most efficient is interviewing, users directly or different people involved in product development - business owners, customer service consultants, etc.<br/>
Asking the right questions in the right manner is very important here, because human psychology is rather tricky - many times what we say is not what we actually do, but rather what we would like to do or we think we are doing, so it's essential to skip all the conceiving layers and get to the underlying truth.</p> 
<p>The other way UX designers can get to know the users is by studying their behavior in similar situations, with similar products - is there a particular way they are doing certain actions or achieving certain goals, do they have some preferences, habits...<br/>
Some really helpful stuff come out of this initial research, at least something to start from.</p>

<h5>Prototyping</h5>
<p>Then comes the tricky part - how to translate these research results into a user friendly product? 
This is the moment when UX designer includes other members of the product design team, utilizing their expertise and experience (product managers, visual designers, developers...). UX designer shares all the insights from the research phase, and together they start drafting product features, copying best practices, combining them with new ideas, iterating, refining until they come up with a product design which seems like "the thing".</p>

<h5>Testing</h5>
<p>It is considered a good practice to exercise a lean approach in UX design, meaning not to go too deep into defining all the bells and whistles of the final product, but to outline main features into minimal viable product, something that is presentable to the users but won't take months and months to develop. The reason for lean UX approach is the fact that in this stage the design team still doesn't know how the users will react to the product, are all of their predictions and assumptions correct? The only way to find out is to test the main principles with real users - do they find the workflow efficient and logical, where are the possible pitfalls? Only after testing and refining is the product ready for the real world.</p>
