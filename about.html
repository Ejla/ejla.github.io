    <h2>... Design Process</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <h4>UX/UI Design</h4>
        <p>As a UX designer, I specialize in web applications with advanced user interactions and data
          presentation, where the focus is not solely on presentation/visual design but <strong>how screens and
            interactions flow together to compose a complete experience</strong>, such as business software, admin
          interfaces, dashboards, user portals, etc.</p>
        <p>The goal is to make the users feel comfortable and confident about what exactly they can
          accomplish and how.</p>
        <p><strong>UX design process starts with research</strong> about business goals, about process the application
          needs to support and about users - their needs, expectations, context, behavior… </p>
        <p>Based on the insights, we start <strong>creating concepts, outlining the future product</strong> (using
          sketches, wireframes and other relevant UX methods and techniques) <strong>iterating and gradually refining
            the design until it reaches the stage where it becomes ready for coding.</strong></p>
        <p>It is important to outline that <strong>UX design is a team process</strong> - it includes all members of the
          product development team. The specific role
          of UX Designer is to facilitate the design process, ask the right questions, point
          out the issues, suggest and visualize possible solutions, document what is defined in different stages, and
          finally, to sum it all up into clean, structured, user-friendly interface design.</p>
        <p>Depending on the specific situation, deliveries of the UX design process can range from <strong>low-fidelity
            wireframes</strong> (that focus on the flow and leave out visual design) to <strong>high-fidelity screen
            mockups</strong> with all of the visual elements of UI defined and ready for coding.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <h4>UI Coding</h4>
        <p>Once the design of your web application is more or less defined, it needs to be “translated” into
          HTML/CSS/SCSS templates, which can then be handed over to developers to include the logic.</p>

        <h5>Requirements for high quality frontend code:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>works in most popular modern browsers and platforms</li>
          <li>responsive to different screen sizes and resolutions</li>
          <li>well structured, modular and maintainable</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Techniques, tools and frameworks available to coders develop and change over time, so to acchieve the best
          results it is very important to keep up with the latest trends - some of my favourite tools and frameworks are
          <strong>Figma</strong> (for designing and prototyping), <strong>Browser Inspector Tools</strong> (for UI
          analysis, redesign and bug-fixing),
          <strong>Sass</strong> (for structured and maintainable styles) and
          <strong>Git</strong> (for version controlling).
        </p>
        <p>I also have experience with programming languages and frameworks such as <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>,
          <strong>JavaScript</strong>, <strong>React</strong> and <strong>PHP</strong>, which makes the communication
          with other memebers of the development team much easier.

    <h2>... Me</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>I am a generalist by nature, and I wore many hats in my professional career - I was once a teacher, an office
          assistant,
          a
          marketing consultant, an internet entrepreneur, a wannabe permaculture farmer, a web designer, a WordPress
          developer and finally I
          settled as a UX/UI Designer, but with a twist - a designer who codes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>I like diversity in everything I do and I like to learn new things. That's why I don't shy away from any
          product type or any subject matter that I need to research in order to make my designs relevant and on target.
