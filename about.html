      <br/>
      <p>I have experience as a web-developer (full stack) on smaller websites or simple webapps using WordPress, Jekyll or Ruby on Rails. I find it valuable for my work - it helps me make informed decisions already in planning and design phase of product development, and communicate better with back end developers.</p>

  <h2>The Process</h2>
  <div class="row">
    <div class="col-6">
      <h4>UX Design</h4>
      <p>As a UX designer, I am specialized in building web applications with advanced user interactions and data presentation, where the focus is not solely on presentation/visual design but <strong>how screens and interactions flow together to compose a complete experience</strong>, such as business software, admin interfaces, booking sites, etc.</p>
      <p>The goal is to make the users feel comfortable in your application and confident about what exactly they can accomplish and how.</p>
      <p><strong>UX design process starts with research</strong> about business goals, about process the application needs to support and about users - their needs, expectations, context, behavior… </p>
      <p>Based on the insights, we start <strong>creating concepts, outlining the future product</strong> (using sketches, wireframes and other relevant UX methods and techniques) <strong>iterating and gradually refining the design until it reaches the stage where it becomes ready for coding.</strong></p>
      <p>It is important to outline that <strong>UX design is a team process</strong> - it includes all members of the product development team (product managers, developers, designers, business owners, etc.) as well as future users. The specific role of UX Designer is to facilitate the design process, ask the right questions, point out the issues, suggest and visualize possible solutions, document what is defined in different stages, and finally, to sum it all up into clean, structured, user-friendly interface design.</p>
      <p>Depending on the specific situation, deliveries of the UX design process can range from <strong>low-fidelity wireframes</strong> (that focus on the flow and leave out visual design) to <strong>high-fidelity screen mockups</strong> with all of the visual elements of UI defined and ready for coding.</p>

    <div class="col-6">
      <h4>UI Development - Coding</h4>
      <p>Once the design of your web application is more or less defined, it needs to be “translated” into frontend code - HTML, CSS and Javascript, which can then be handed over to backend developers to include the logic.</p>
      <p>This part of the application development can be based on my own design, or on your source design files from layered graphics format such as PSD, AI or Sketch</p>
<h5>Requirements for high quality frontend code:</h5>
<ul>
  <li>works in most popular modern browsers and platforms</li>
  <li>responsive to different screen sizes and resolutions</li>
  <li>well structured, modular and maintainable</li>
</ul>
<p>Techniques, tools and frameworks available to coders develop and change over time, so to acchieve the best results it is very important to keep up with the latest trends - some of my favourite tools and frameworks are <strong>Sketch</strong> (for designing and prototyping), <strong>Bootstrap</strong> (for responsive design), <strong>Sass</strong> (for structured and maintainable styles), <strong>jQuery</strong> (for interaction) and <strong>Git</strong> (for version controlling).</p> 
<p>I also have substantial experience with <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong> - I am able to integrate my frontend code seamlessly with already existing backend code, which makes the process of the app development faster and more flexible.</p>

  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>My first job related to web technologies was Content Manager of a corporate website about 10 years ago. I continued the journey as a <strong>founder and product manager of a web startup project</strong>, and in the process grew fond of UX design and UI development, which I chose to be my profession.</p>
  <p><strong>For the last 7 years</strong> I've been exploring what works and doesn’t work in product development, learning the secrets and value of a good user experience. I like to test new theories in practice, so I always have some pet-project brewing in the background.</p>
