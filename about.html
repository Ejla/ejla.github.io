  <h2>My Journey</h2>

    <div class="grid-col-2">
      <div>
        <h4>Professional Background</h4>
        <p>Throughout my career I’ve worked in several different industries (education, administration, sales &
          marketing), but one thing I’ve always loved is solving complex problems with
          simple design solutions. In 2010 I decided to pursue a career in web design and development, and later on
          specialized in UX/UI and product design.</p>

        <h4 style="margin-top: 20px;">Personal Projects</h4>
        <p>I’m always looking for ways to improve the world around me through design. One such example is <a
            href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/farmicon.html"><strong>Farmicon</strong></a>, a
          tool I
          developed to help small local farmers connect with their regular customers, offering an intuitive platform for
          weekly
          offers, orders, and deliveries.</p>

      <div>
        <img class="illustration" src="../assets/images/empathy.svg" alt="">
        <h4>Empathy</h4>
        <p>I design with the user in mind, making sure that the products I create are accessible and easy to use for
          everyone,
          regardless of their technical abilities.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img class="illustration" src="../assets/images/collaboration.svg" alt="">

          developers, and
          users.</p>
