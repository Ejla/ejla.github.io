    <div class=" row">
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          Small scale farmers needed a simple solution to move their sales (from local food markets) online - the demand
          for their
          products was huge, but the complexity of owning a web shop and managing the technical and legal site of it was
          too much
          for them.
        </p>
        <p>
          So we created a simple online platform that farmers can use to quickly publish their offers and collect
          preorders. They
          could publish offers on weekly basis, and dedicate one day for packing and delivery, either directly to the
          buyers, or
          to some pre-arranged common delivery location.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class="col-6">
        <p>
          The difference from a classic web-shops is the community component - all activities were organised within
          groups. A
          farmer would open a group and invite their customers to join and follow their offers. It could also be the
          other way
          around - groups of consumers would open a group and then invite farmers of their choice.</p>
        <p>
          That model of selling/buying local food turned out to be a success, a great way to nurture long-time
          relationships
          between farmers and their customers. Unfortunately, the product didn’t fit into existing legal landscape and
          it
          couldn’t
          scale to a successful business, so we took care of our existing customers and moved on.
          But we all know that 9 out of 10 startups fail, so, hoping for a better luck next time :o)

      <p><strong>Research - User Personas

        </strong><br />
        At the time some ways of organizing local farmers and customers were already forming, but the way they
        communicated
        and
        organized the groups, offers and orders (usually through google groups and Google Forms) was cumbersome and
        prone to
        errors. After a careful research I identified 6 personas who would benefit from such a product.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/assets/images/projects/farmicon/farmicon-01.png"
          alt="Farmicon - Local Food Software" />
      </div>
      <p><strong>Product Page</strong><br />
        The product targets small scale farmers and groups of customers, and introduces a specific flow that makes the
        whole
        process of selling and buying local food online managable and frictionless. Explaining the value proposition was
        one of
        the greatest challenges because the product was quite unique.
      </p>

    <div class="col-6">
      <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/assets/images/projects/farmicon/farmicon-02.png"
          alt="Farmicon - Local Food Software" />
      </div>
      <p><strong>Overview of Current Offers
        </strong><br />
        Farmers and their loyal customers would organize into a group - farmers would publish their offers on regular
        basis
        (usually weekly), define in advance common delivery locations or direct delivery timespan. Offers would have a
        deadline by which customers can place orders, and then it's time for farmers to pick, pack and deliver the
        orders.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-6">
      <div class="img-container">
        <img src="/assets/images/projects/farmicon/farmicon-03.png"
          alt="Farmicon - Local Food Software" />
      </div>
      <p><strong>Order Form

        </strong><br />
        Unlike classic web-shop, Farmicon's first concern wasn't how to help farmers sell more, but how to sell
        efficiently.<br />
        Small farmers usually have limited quantities of produce, which they can either pick and pack for next delivery,
        or
        leave on the field to grow, and it's hard for them to know in advance what they will have ready for harvest, so
        stock
        management is redundant.<br />Instead, we designed tools that gave them the flexibility to adjust delivered
        quantities and
        re-calculate prices, or block certain product on the go.</p>

    <div class="col-6">

      </div>
      <p><strong>Farmer's Profile Page

        </strong><br />
        Very important part of the farmer-consumer long term relationship is farmer's story - customers need to feel
        they can
        trust them, they need to see where they grow their food, if they have required certificates etc. so Farmer
        Profile page
        was important part of the app.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="col-6">

      </div>
      <p><strong>Final Product
        </strong><br />
        This simple fusion of online and offline sales process turned out to be a success. It was efficient but still
        felt real
        and personal, just as buying food should be.
        Unfortunately, the food sector is very restrictive and selling food online turned out to be much more regulated
        compared to classic farmers
        markets, which we tried to mimic. The rigid rules didn't allow for the flexibility and ease of use, which was
        Farmicon's strongest
        value proposition.</p>
