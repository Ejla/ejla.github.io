  <h5>Project Highlights:</h5>
  <p>Main goal was to create very simple and intuitive web application that will enable IT department to create a sort of a homepage - bookmark list for each company employee's mobile device. The content of the <strong>homepage reflects different access rights</strong> of each employee, displaying only the bookmarks they are entitled to, so the admin interface had to enable grouping bookmarks into categories.<br/>
    Homepage also has to reflect visual identity of the company brand, so all of the <strong>visual elements are customizable</strong> - company title/logo, background, colors, fonts, icons - or one of the predefined skins can be used.<br/>
    In most cases icons and titles of bookmarks in <strong>thumbnail layout</strong> are sufficient, but some of the companies expressed a need for more detailed description of the bookmark, in which case they are using the list layout.</p>
