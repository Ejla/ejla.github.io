  <p>I was front-end part of the team of two - I covered product concept, visual design, UX/UI design, coding in HTML/CSS (Bootstrap)/jQuery, parts of back-end coding in Ruby on Rails, QA, product launch, implementation and support.</p>
  <h5>Project Highlights:</h5>
  <p>The main goal was to build UI that "speaks for itself" - the underlying offering and ordering process is not simple, so I had to figure out how to help users understand where they are in the process, what are next available steps and give clear feedback on their actions, taking into account various levels of users' IT literacy.</p>
  <p>That was accomplished by clear <strong>information architecture</strong>, <strong>functional minimalism</strong> (introducing not more than absolutely neccessary actions) and <strong>contextual actions</strong> (displaying only those actions relevant to the current step of the process), <strong>hierarchy of control</strong> (controls which affect an object are grouped with the object), providing<strong> descriptive contextual help</strong> and <strong>feedback messages</strong>.</p>
