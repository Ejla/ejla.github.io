  <h5>Project Highlights:</h5>
  <p>The main goal of UI redesign was to <strong>reduce visual clutter</strong> of existing UI, but at the same time <strong>keep the same sequence of steps and grouping of information</strong> the users got used to.<br/>
    That required thorough <strong>layout redesign</strong> - moving top navigation to the left, introducing 2-column main content layout and a sidebar.<br/>
    The next step was to <strong>prioritise the contents and actions</strong> - place crucial ones in more accessible areas of the UI, move less important ones out of the way. New layout also enabled <strong>more efficient tracking and comparing data</strong>, which appeared to be one of the more important tasks and needed a better support.<br/><strong>Simple and clean design</strong> reduces visual clutter and highlights most important contents and actions.</p>
